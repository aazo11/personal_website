We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco, and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small businesses across the country, and we’re building a workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. \n\nAbout the role\n\nGusto’s AI/ML Eng team leverages our rich dataset to guide product direction and decision-making by building the right solutions at scale. We’re looking for a senior technical leader (individual contributor) who will design robust AI/ML systems and services through close partnership with seasoned leaders across Engineering, Product, Design, Data Science, Marketing, and Customer Excellence. This means you will also define the strategy along with shipping impactful models and services to evolve our AI/ML capabilities and practices.\n\nWe have several open roles across two embedded areas:\n\nUnified Service Platform optimizes our customer experience, creates personalized engagement moments, and drives automated or AI enhanced assistance. We develop AI tools and platform components (ex. embedding algorithms) to improve performance and customer satisfaction.\nGrowth builds AI/ML-powered experiences that drive relevant, timely product adoption. Our team enables contextual customer interactions through growth-oriented capabilities like propensity modeling and recommendations.\nHere’s what you’ll do day-to-day\nDesign and develop scalable, production-grade AI/ML models and services for complex business and customer experience problems.\nLead technical strategy and architecture for key AI/ML domains, including model lifecycle, observability, safety, and evaluation.\nCollaborate cross-functionally to identify high-leverage AI/ML opportunities, translate them into actionable roadmaps, and deliver measurable outcomes.\nBuild, harden, and operate platform capabilities that power customer journey experiences (e.g., personalization, assistance, routing, content selection).\nStay current with the latest AI/ML research; prototype, evaluate, and productionize new algorithms and techniques from academia and industry.\nEstablish robust practices for validation, deployment, monitoring, explainability, and ongoing performance management.\nCommunicate findings, roadmaps, tradeoffs, and impact clearly to executives and non-technical partners.\nMentor engineers and scientists, fostering a culture of technical excellence and pragmatic innovation.\nHere’s what we’re looking for\n8+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying end-to-end AI/ML systems in industry or academia.\nDeep expertise in one or more advanced ML areas (e.g., supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, NLP, LLMs, retrieval/RAG, reinforcement learning). \nOur Growth positions would require a background in growth-oriented solutions (e.g., propensity scoring, recommendation systems, forecasting, lead scoring) and experimentation.\nProven track record delivering large, impactful AI/ML projects into production environments with measurable business and customer impact. \nExperience monitoring AI agents with an attention to safety/guardrails, evaluation frameworks, and sentiment/quality analysis is necessary for the Unified Service Platform roles but not required for our Growth positions.\nProficiency with modern ML frameworks and tooling (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face) and cloud platforms (e.g., GCP, AWS, or Azure). \nHands-on experience building LLM-based applications and agentic AI workflows (e.g., Claude, Gemini, OpenAI), including prompt/retrieval design and evaluation, is a bonus.\nStrong programming skills in Python and sound software engineering fundamentals (testing, code review, CI/CD, reliability).\nDemonstrated leadership in cross-disciplinary settings and the ability to influence direction through technical depth and clarity.\nExcellent communication skills and strong product/business judgment.\nPh.D. or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related field is a plus.\n\nOur cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $230k-280k for San Francisco, New York, and Seattle $205k - 255k in Los Angeles, $185k-234k in Denver, and 200k-250k CAD for Toronto. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors including candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the amounts listed above.\n\nGusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco, and New York City. Employees who are based in those locations will be expected to work from the office on designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more depending on role). The same office expectations apply to all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical office is in Scottsdale.\n\nNote: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas. \n\nWhen approved to work from a location other than a Gusto office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet connection is required. This includes non-office days for hybrid employees.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Gusto. \n\nGusto is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Check out our Intro to Hex video and employee handbook to learn more about what it's like to work at Hex.\n\nAbout the role\n\nHex is an AI-powered platform for modern Data Science and Data Analytics workflows. AI Engineers at Hex partner with product teams to build industry-leading AI experiences such as the Notebook Agent.

Our models serve 600M+ inference calls monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.\n\nWe're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. The adoption has been significant: we now process ~1.5M streaming hours per week, with 25x usage growth in the last six months alone. Our research team drives these advances and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've already launched keyterms prompting feature and multilingual support—with more significant improvements on the roadmap.\n\nWe've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator's AI Fund, Patrick and John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross.

As a government contractor subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we request this information in order to measure the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to VEVRAA. Classification of protected categories is as follows:\n\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\n\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\n\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\n\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\n\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\n\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\n\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\n\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at www.dol.gov/ofccp.\n\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\n\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability. Disabilities include, but are not limited to:\n\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\nBlind or low vision\nCancer (past or present)\nCardiovascular or heart disease\nCeliac disease\nCerebral palsy\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\nDiabetes\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\nIntellectual or developmental disability\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\nShort stature (dwarfism)\nTraumatic brain injury\nDisability Status\nSelect...\n\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.

We operate as a high-velocity 'startup-within-Salesforce,' following our recent acquisition. You’ll be managed by the same founders and engineers who built the original company, offering the autonomy of a small team backed by the global scale and trust of Salesforce. You will have the unique opportunity to build a '0 to 1' product with the founding team, while leveraging Salesforce's world-class Data Cloud and security infrastructure to drive immediate global impact at scale.\n\nGlobal supply chains still rely on slow, manual processes—email, spreadsheets, and fragmented data. The economy moves fast but supply chains don’t, creating an inefficiency that affects the $13T of goods shipped annually and is one of the largest untapped opportunities in modern enterprise.\n\nAgentforce for Supply Chain is reimagining the supply chain with an AI-powered platform for designing, automating, and running end-to-end business processes, with seamless collaboration through familiar channels like email. For Salesforce, this represents a massive growth opportunity in the back office, with innovations that flow into the front office. Customers are clamoring for more, rapidly expanding their use cases as we enter an exhilarating growth phase. As one user put it: “I’ve been waiting for this for 20 years.”\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nAs a Senior/Lead AI Software Engineer, for the Agentforce Supply Chain - Agent Team, you will drive the ongoing development of our agents. These agents complete complex tasks requiring specific outputs reliably. They plan their work ahead of time and execute on that plan in order to drive consistency, correctness, and automation.\n\nDrive Agent Development & Architecture\n\nLead development of intelligent agents that complete complex supply chain tasks with reliability and consistency\n\nSpearhead architectural decisions for distributed systems serving millions of users with 24/7 availability\n\nDesign and implement planning systems that enable agents to execute multi-step workflows autonomously\n\nLead Technical Strategy\n\nPartner with Product Management and Executive Leadership to translate business vision into multi-year technical roadmaps\n\nGuide technical decision-making for AI model deployment, safety constraints, and reliability frameworks\n\nDrive adoption of enterprise-grade observability tools and cloud infrastructure best practices\n\nMentor & Collaborate\n\nMentor engineers to improve code quality, AI/ML practices, and system design\n\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams including Design, Product Management, and industry experts to build high-quality product features\n\nTake on new challenges and responsibilities as needed, and be an enthusiastic team player in a dynamic environment\n\nEngage directly with customers to gather insights and validate technical approaches\n\nParticipate in hiring decisions and contribute to our culture of continuous learning\n\nRequirements\n\nB.S. in Computer Science with coursework in Artificial Intelligence (M.S. preferred)\n\n5+ years (7-12 for Lead, 4-8 for Senior) of industry experience in Software Engineering, with a focus in AI/ML\n\nProficiency in multiple programming languages such as Python, Go, Java, or C++\n\nStrong background in APIs, data modeling, and databases\n\nProficient with modern AI orchestration frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex) and production-grade serving libraries like vLLM or Hugging Face TGI.\n\nDemonstrated ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a dynamic environment\n\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills\n\nPassion for continuous learning and development in AI technologies, and enthusiasm for mentoring peers\n\nA proven collaborator who can manage stakeholders and drive consensus across diverse engineering and product teams.\n\nExperience with enterprise-grade observability tools (e.g., Splunk) and cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP).\n\nFor roles in San Francisco and Los Angeles: Pursuant to the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance and the Los Angeles Fair Chance Initiative for Hiring, Salesforce will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nUnleash Your Potential\n\nWhen you join Salesforce, you’ll be limitless in all areas of your life. Our benefits and resources support you to find balance and be your best, and our AI agents accelerate your impact so you can do your best. Together, we’ll bring the power of Agentforce to organizations of all sizes and deliver amazing experiences that customers love. Apply today to not only shape the future — but to redefine what’s possible — for yourself, for AI, and the world.\n\nAt Salesforce, we strive to create an accessible and inclusive experience for all candidates.\n\nIf you need a reasonable accommodation during the application or the recruiting process, please submit a request via this Accommodation Request Form.\n\nPlease note that Salesforce uses an automated employment decision tool to help our recruiters assess and evaluate candidates’ resumes. If you do not want Salesforce to use this tool with your application, please submit a request via this form.\n\nEqual Opportunity Statement.\n\nSalesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly? It means that at Salesforce, we believe in equality for all. And we believe we can lead the path to equality in part by creating a workplace that’s inclusive, and free from discrimination. Know your rights: workplace discrimination is illegal. Any employee or potential employee will be assessed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications – without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, transgender status, age, disability, veteran or marital status, political viewpoint, or other classifications protected by law. This policy applies to current and prospective employees, no matter where they are in their Salesforce employment journey. It also applies to recruiting, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, assessment of job performance, discipline, termination, and everything in between. Recruiting, hiring, and promotion decisions at Salesforce are fair and based on merit. The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.\n\nAt Salesforce, we believe in equitable compensation practices that reflect the dynamic nature of labor markets across various regions.\n\nThe typical base salary range for this position is $157,600 - $253,000 annually. In select cities within the San Francisco and New York City metropolitan area, the base salary range for this role is $172,000 - $276,100 annually.\n\nThe range represents base salary only, and does not include company bonus, incentive for sales roles, equity or benefits, as applicable.\n\n\n\nSalesforce welcomes all.\n\nIn the United States, compensation offered will be determined by factors such as location, job level, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. Salesforce offers a variety of benefits to help you live well including: time off programs, medical, dental, vision, mental health support, paid parental leave, life and disability insurance, 401(k), and an employee stock purchasing program.
